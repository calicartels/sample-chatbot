WELCOME_MESSAGE = """
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the ProAxion Sensor Installation Assistant!

I'll help you determine the optimal sensor placement for your machine and guide you through the installation process step-by-step.

To get started, please tell me what type of machine you're working with: Fan, Motor, or Pump?
"""

# Machine type selection prompts
FAN_CONFIGURATION_PROMPT = """
Great! Let's set up your fan sensors.

What type of fan configuration do you have?
- Belt Driven: Uses belts and pulleys to connect motor and fan
- Direct/Close Coupled: Motor shaft directly connected to fan
- Independent Bearing: Separate bearing system for the fan shaft

Please select one of these options or describe your setup.
"""

MOTOR_CONFIGURATION_PROMPT = """
Great! Let's set up your motor sensors.

What type of motor configuration do you have?
- AC Induction Motor
- DC Motor
- Synchronous Motor
- Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)

Please select one of these options or describe your setup.
"""

PUMP_CONFIGURATION_PROMPT = """
Great! Let's set up your pump sensors.

What type of pump configuration do you have?
- Centrifugal Pump
- Positive Displacement Pump
- Submersible Pump
- Vertical Turbine Pump

Please select one of these options or describe your setup.

# Additional information prompts
ORIENTATION_PROMPT = """
Is your {machine_type} center hung or overhung?

- Center Hung: Support on both sides of the {machine_type}
- Overhung: Support on only one side
"""

RPM_PROMPT = """
What is the operational speed of your {machine_type} in RPM?

This helps determine the optimal sensor configuration for your specific equipment.
"""

SENSOR_COUNT_PROMPT = """
How many sensors do you currently have available for installation?

This will help me recommend the most effective placement based on your available resources.
"""

MONITORING_TARGET_PROMPT = """
Is there a specific part of the machine you'd like to monitor?

For example:
- Motor bearings
- Fan housing
- Drive shaft
- Coupling

Or type "general" if you want a recommendation for overall monitoring.
"""

# Recommendation templates
RECOMMENDATION_TEMPLATE = """
Based on your {configuration} {machine_type} configuration, the ideal setup would be {ideal_count} sensors for comprehensive monitoring.
